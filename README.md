# JavaZMach
A Z-Machine interpreter in Java

Work in progress. Currently this interpreter is able to run ZORK1 (version Z3).<br>
When importing this project in Eclipse, tick "Check for nested projects" in the import dialog.<br>
There is currently one UI backend; located in JavaZMachConsoleUI. (JavaZMachSWTUI is only a stub)
